# Simple Yogimass Workflow Example
# This workflow demonstrates the minimum viable slice: ingestion, processing, and similarity.

workflow:
  name: "simple-similarity-check"
  version: "1.0"

input:
  # Path to input spectra file (MGF, MSP, etc.)
  source: "tests/data/test_spectra.mgf"
  format: "mgf"

processing:
  # Sequential filters to apply using matchms
  filters:
    - name: "normalize_intensities"
    - name: "select_by_relative_intensity"
      params:
        intensity_from: 0.01

similarity:
  method: "cosine"  # or "spec2vec"
  tolerance: 0.005

output:
  # Where to save the results
  path: "results/scores.json"
